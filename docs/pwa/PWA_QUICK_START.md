# PWA Quick Start - For Rody 📱

**Your Helix Status Dashboard is now a full Progressive Web App!**

## 🎯 What This Means

✅ **Install it on your iPhone** like a native app  
✅ **Works offline** when traveling (shows last data)  
✅ **Loads instantly** from cache after first visit  
✅ **No browser UI** - feels like a real app  
✅ **Auto-updates** when new versions are deployed  

## 📱 Install on Your iPhone (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Open in Safari
Go to: **https://helix-status.rodytech.ai**  
(Must use Safari, not Chrome)

### Step 2: Tap Share Button
Look for the **square with arrow pointing up** at the bottom of Safari

### Step 3: Add to Home Screen
- Scroll down the share menu
- Tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
- Tap **"Add"** to confirm

### Step 4: Done!
Look for the **Helix** icon with the blue gradient on your home screen.  
Tap to launch!

## 🎨 What You'll See

- **Fullscreen app** (no Safari UI)
- **Blue gradient icon** matching the dashboard design
- **Black translucent status bar** at top
- **Same features** as web version
- **Offline indicator** when no internet

## ✈️ Using While Traveling

### Before Your Flight:
1. **Open the app** while on WiFi (home, hotel, airport lounge)
2. **Navigate through all views** (Dashboard, Projects, Analytics, History)
3. This caches everything for offline use

### During Flight:
1. **Open app from home screen** (works without WiFi!)
2. **View last cached data** - shows status from last time you were online
3. **All navigation works** - switch between views normally
4. **Theme toggle works** - light/dark mode persists

### After Landing:
- **Connect to WiFi** - app automatically fetches fresh data
- **Data updates** in real-time like normal
- **Cache replenishes** for next offline session

## 🔄 Auto-Updates

When I deploy updates to the dashboard:

1. **You'll see a popup**: "New content available! Reload to update?"
2. **Tap OK** to get the latest version
3. **Or ignore it** and keep using the current version
4. **Automatic check** every hour for updates

## 🎛️ Features That Work Offline

✅ **Full UI** - all views and navigation  
✅ **Last cached data** - status from when you were last online  
✅ **Theme toggle** - dark/light mode  
✅ **Settings persist** - your preferences saved  

❌ **Real-time updates** - needs internet for fresh data  
❌ **API calls** - shows cached responses when offline  

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Add to Home Screen" Not Showing
- Make sure you're using **Safari** (not Chrome)
- Not in Private Browsing mode

### App Not Loading Offline
- Open app **while online first** to populate cache
- Navigate through all views to cache them

### Icon Not Appearing Correctly
- Give it a few seconds after adding
- May need to restart iPhone (rare)

### Want to Reinstall
- Long press icon → **Remove App**
- Follow install steps again

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Pin to Dock**: Drag icon to bottom dock for quickest access
2. **Check Before Travel**: Open app before flights to refresh cache
3. **Updates**: Say "yes" to update prompts to get latest features
4. **Battery**: Standalone apps use less battery than Safari tabs

## 🎉 That's It!

You're all set! The Helix Status Dashboard is now in your pocket, ready for your travels.
